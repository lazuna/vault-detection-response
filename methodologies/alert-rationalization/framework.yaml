    poor signal quality, and unclear ownership leading to missed 
    incidents and burnt-out on-call teams.
  
  solution_approach: |
    Systematic framework for alert lifecycle management combining
    taxonomy, quality metrics, rationalization methodology, and
    continuous improvement processes.
  
  key_outcomes:
    - "60-80% reduction in daily alert volume"
    - "50-70% reduction in pages per on-call shift"
    - "40-60% reduction in MTTR for incidents"
    - "80-90% reduction in false positive rates"

  core_design:
    
    root_cause_correlation:
      description: "Intelligent alert grouping presents one consolidated alert for related issues"
      
      implementation:
        - "Map service dependencies explicitly"
        - "Configure alert suppression for known correlations"
        - "Use event correlation engines (BigPanda, Moogsoft)"
        - "Implement alert deduplication based on root cause"
      
      example:
        bad:
          - "Database connection errors: 50 alerts"
          - "API latency high: 25 alerts"
          - "Service unavailable: 15 alerts"
          - "Total: 90 alerts overwhelming responders"
        
        good:
          - "Database primary failure → cascading impacts detected"
          - "Single consolidated alert with impact summary"
          - "Total: 1 alert with full context"
    
    signal_to_noise_optimization:
      description: "Maintain low baseline noise through careful threshold tuning"
      
      techniques:
        - "Use dynamic thresholds based on historical patterns"
        - "Implement statistical methods (standard deviation, percentiles)"
        - "Apply time-of-day and day-of-week adjustments"
        - "Leverage machine learning for anomaly detection"
      
      threshold_evolution:
        static: "CPU > 80% (generates noise during normal peaks)"
        better: "CPU > P95 of last 30 days"
        best: "CPU > P95 + 2σ with time-of-day adjustment"
      
      quality_targets:
        false_positive_rate: "<5%"
        actionable_alert_rate: ">95%"

        critical:
          threshold: "85% CPU sustained for 5 minutes"
          action: "Immediate investigation and resolution"
          escalation: "Page on-call engineer"
